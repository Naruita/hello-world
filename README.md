# Hello World
My Git starts off with a hello world.

Hey guys,
My name is Adithya, and I'm using my GitHub account for the first time even 
though i've had it for multiple days till now.
Feel free to give me advice or feedback, I'll take it as constructive criticism.
Peace!

I'm glad to say that I'm working a lot more on code now, and have been using
GitHub a lot more. While I haven't made any significant contribution to any
large scale project yet, I have learnt to use VCS and GitHub better.
I've tried to work on a variety of projects and would like to show them off.
<pre>
<a href="https://github.com/dat-adi/Java-Grip">Java-Grip</a>  : A compilation of Java Programs that I've worked on.
<a href="https://github.com/dat-adi/tinyApps">tinyApps</a>   : A few small scale apps that I've developed on an impulse.
<a href="https://github.com/dat-adi/TheDescend">TheDescend</a> : A game project on building a Dungeon RPG.
<a href="https://github.com/atvc19ec/tul-s-corp">Tul's Corp</a> : A collaborative project on making a text based office game, that I've worked on.

It has been a long time since an update, but, here's what I've done over the 
course of 8 months. In terms of contributions, I've only contributed a single 
line of code to rptools/maptools, and yet have to add in support for local 
assets in the application. I've also changed my account name from Naruita to 
dat-adi, and have worked on multiple repositories.

I've learnt how to work with Python a lot more in depth than before, and my 
repository for small applications called `tinyApps` has come a long way with
new features, comprising of an automated annotation maker of the files present 
in a directory, and a web scraping EPUB maker. Now, the tools that I can use 
have grown a lot larger, requiring a list of sorts,
 - Beautiful Soup
 - PostgreSQL
 - Tkinter
 - XML -> EPUB Conversion
 - Django Based Web Development
 - Working with VIM as a text editor
 
I'm currently directing a team to build a Django-based centralized hub for the
[Winter Season of Code](https://www.wsocbyosc.com). I'm also a technical writer 
for [JournalDev](https://www.askpython.com), and write articles on Python modules.

##### 28/04/2021
It's been about 4 months since an update, so here I am.<br>
The Django-based project that I have headed for the duration of 3-4 months 
concluded on March 1st.<br>
The project is known as [OSCHub](https://github.com/Open-Source-Community-VIT-AP/oschub),
and I'm pretty proud of it.<br>
This project has been given the position of the best project in WSoC2020, 
and I'm pretty stoked about it.

OSCHub is currently being improved further however, in order to get it to 
a true production level stage where students can register for events through 
it's portal.

I have now officially converted to Linux. It was just a leap that was long overdue. 
I took it.<br>
I've started the journey with Ubuntu but, while it was nice. It wasn't enough of a 
challenge.<br>
Upon further research into Linux distros, I decided that one more leap wouldn't hurt.<br>
So, I picked **Arch Linux**.

I can't say that I'm sorry however.<br>
Keeping aside the first few weeks where I struggled with Internet, Audio, and 
Window Managers, I genuinely enjoy working on a new environment now.

A list of things that I discovered on Arch Linux are,
 - Qtile
 - Symlinked Dotfiles
 - Alacritty
 - Doom Emacs
 - Pain

And, getting to the skillset that I've developed, from the last time,
 - Technical Writing
 - I'm seriously clueless.
 - I hit gold in Valorant.

I now spend my days working towards management more than coding, as the Open 
Source Community begins to work on larger projects, and I direct and support
the community as a Vice President.

##### 11/04/2022
It's been a year since an update, and there's been quite a few changes. 
Quite a bit too much to record honestly, but I'll try!<br>

Career-wise? I've progressed to become the President of the Open Source 
Community of VIT-AP (05/21), and had OSCHub deployed to be used actively by 
the community for event management. I'm yet to start interning at 
[Price Waterhouse Coopers](https://www.pwc.in/), I'm to be a Technical 
Consultant in a month or so.

Configuration-wise? I've made quite a few changes to the way I work on code,
or just use my laptop in general. I now run Arch on a [Lenovo Legion 5](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-5-series/Legion-5-15ACH6H/p/88GMY501582).
I currently use [Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway), a wayland compositor,
and I really like it, more details about the configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/dat-adi/dotfiles).

I use DOOM Emacs for note-taking extensively now. With notes, and journal 
entries being my form of expressing what I'm learning, it's a pretty great application!
I've also joined a few organizations, such as [Agni](https://github.com/agni-ems)
for the development of a university management system, and [ForgeFlux](https://github.com/forgeflux-org/)
to develop on API-space software forge federation tech.

Just as a sidenote, the refresh rate and the smoothness of a new laptop is 
amazing on Arch. Of course, I did have to dual boot it with Windows since I 
do game as well. Ahem, platinum 1 on Valorant, ahem.

##### 13/07/2022
I'm back at the college right now, and if I'm accurate about my calendar, 
I have one more month left until I'm done with college physically. It feels 
kinda weird considering that I did most of my education at home with covid 
around the corner. I'm not sure how I feel about the end yet. I did have 
fun with college while it lasted I suppose, found some really cool friends,
and met some really smart people.

I finally feel like I've found a field that I'm interested in, wouldn't mind
pursuing and which actually intrigues me into performing experiments,
[Software-Defined Networking](https://opennetworking.org/sdn-definition/).
I'm currently working on a project in the same domain, which I might not be
allowed to speak about yet, but if everything goes well, I think I'll end up 
with a research paper and some credit to my name.
The toolkit that I'm using and actively trying to work more with only grows
vaster,
 - VirtualBox / QEMU
 - Mininet / Mininet-Wifi
 - Wireshark
 - Floodlight Controller
 - OpenDaylight Controller
 - Ryu Controller

The Open Source Community has been handed over to the successors of the source.
It was a fun run being part of the community, and frankly, I don't think I 
would have learnt what it was like being part of the management if I was never
a part of it. Right about now, I can organize hackathons, codeathons, bootcamps,
tech talks, summer of codes, web hunts, and linux conversion days. Moreover,
I've set up the digital space for the community at GitHub, Discord, and Matrix.
I've learnt a lot, and I hope that the future generations of OSC learn just as 
much.

With regards to my career, I've finished my tenure at PwC as a Technical Consultant,
it was a very weird experience considering that whenever I received work, it was
on a very short deadline, and they expected accurate results in the required timeframe.
But, on the other hand, there were periods where I didn't receive any work at all, this
was cool too since I got to explore SDNs and revise the fundamental networking concepts.
I did mess around with [novel crawlers](https://github.com/dat-adi/novel-crawlers-v2) 
again during this timeframe, and managed to rework the model leveraging the capabilities 
of [Redis](https://redis.io/). It was a fruitful learning experience where I worked with
[rq](https://python-rq.org/) as well.

That was quite a bit, I'll wrap up by saying that I hit Diamond 1 in Valorant. ;)

##### 31/12/2022 

I'm out of college! No, I don't mean dropped out. But, I don't have to stay at 
the college and attend courses offline anymore.

I'm not going to write too much about the past year, despite it being really 
cool simply because I wrote a [post](https://datadi.murgi.org/posts/for-the-new-year/) 
about it instead. I haven't quite discovered or learnt anything new per se with 
regards to tech, but I did manage to [fix up my neovim environment](https://datadi.murgi.org/posts/dotfiles/)
to work much better.

I don't know how, but I'm Ascendant 1 in Valorant now.

##### 25/06/2023

I'm at the end of yet another arc in my life. Here's a list of things that I've 
done over the course of the past six months.
- Joined as an Intern at Bajaj Markets.
- Got put into the Data Engineering Team (!?)
- Found out that Data Engineering was actually fun.
- Met some amazing people in and out of the team.
- Built a robust and extensible data migration pipeline from scratch.
- Published two research papers on SDNs: [Advanced Networking Applications](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370987816_A_Study_on_Advanced_Networking_using_Intelligent_Systems_Applications) and [ASM-SDN](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-023-05392-z).

Despite doing a decent chunk of work, somehow it still feels like I haven't quite
gotten anywhere and that I've wasted the past few months for some reason. I don't 
know why, and even worse is that I don't know where to start understanding why.
Oh, and I've also been working out, which is cool. I'm healthy now.

With respect to my technical knowledge growth, there are a few things that I
can point out to be softwares that I use on a regular basis while at work, here's
a list,
- [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/).
- Pandas, [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/), [Pyarrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html).
- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/getting_started/index.html), [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, Amazon Redshift.
- PL/SQL.
- [Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/), [GPSG](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

It does dawn upon me that, despite working on cool new things, I'm still
missing something, but I can't place my finger on it. I've discovered better
coding guidelines, optimized thought processes and have adopted a lot of great
coding standards. The world too is in a weird place right now that I'm not sure
whether to look at as the "go-to" spot.

It's a pretty weird state of affairs. But, hey, it's starting to rain in Pune.
This means that I can go on all kinds of treks now. I can't wait.
