# Hello World
My Git starts off with a hello world.

Hey guys,
My name is Adithya, and I'm using my GitHub account for the first time even though i've had it for multiple days till now.
Feel free to give me advice or feedback, i'll take it as constructive criticism.
Peace!

I'm glad to say that I'm working a lot more on code now, and have been using GitHub a lot more.<br>
While, I haven't made any significant contribution to any large scale project yet, I have learnt to use VCS and GitHub better.
I've tried to work on a variety of projects and would like to show them off.
<pre>
<a href="https://github.com/dat-adi/Java-Grip">Java-Grip</a>  : A compilation of Java Programs that I've worked on.
<a href="https://github.com/dat-adi/tinyApps">tinyApps</a>   : A few small scale apps that I've developed on an impulse.
<a href="https://github.com/dat-adi/TheDescend">TheDescend</a> : A game project on building a Dungeon RPG.
<a href="https://github.com/atvc19ec/tul-s-corp">Tul's Corp</a> : A collaborative project on making a text based office game, that I've worked on.

It has been a long time since an update, but, here's what I've done over the course of 8 months.
In terms of contributions, I've only contributed a single line of code to rptools/maptools, and yet have to add in support for local assets in the application.
I've also changed my account name from Naruita to dat-adi, and have worked on multiple repositories.

I've learnt how to work with Python a lot more in depth than before, and my repository for small applications called `tinyApps` has come a long way with new features, comprising of an automated annotation maker of the files present in a directory, and a web scraping EPUB maker.
Now, the tools that I can use have grown a lot larger, requiring a list of sorts,
 - Beautiful Soup
 - PostgreSQL
 - Tkinter
 - XML -> EPUB Conversion
 - Django Based Web Development
 - Working with VIM as a text editor
 
 I'm currently directing a team to build a Django-based centralized hub for [Winter Season of Code](https://www.wsocbyosc.com).
 I'm also a technical writer for [JournalDev](https://www.askpython.com), and write articles on Python modules.

<a href="https://github.com/dat-adi/time-tabler">Time Tabler</a> : An experiment of trying to automate my timetable for college, with the script being able to automatically open up the classes.
<a href="https://github.com/dat-adi/eisen-tickets">Eisen's Tickets</a> : An application made to learn the implementation of Databases, Tkinter, and Python.

It's been about 4 months since an update, so here I am.<br>
The Django-based project that I have headed for the duration of 3-4 months concluded on March 1st.<br>
The project is known as [OSCHub](https://github.com/Open-Source-Community-VIT-AP/oschub), and I'm pretty proud of it.<br>
This project has been given the position of the best project in WSoC2020, and I'm pretty stoked about it.

OSCHub is currently being improved further however, in order to get it to a true production level stage where students can register for events through it's portal.

I have now officially converted to Linux. It was just a leap that was long overdue. I took it.<br>
I'ved started the journey with Ubuntu but, while it was nice. It wasn't enough of a challenge.<br>
Upon further research into Linux distros, I decided that one more leap wouldn't hurt.<br>
So, I picked **Arch Linux**.

I can't say that I'm sorry however.<br>
Keeping aside the first few weeks where I struggled with Internet, Audio, and Window Managers, I genuinely enjoy working on a new environment now.

A list of things that I discovered on Arch Linux are,
 - Qtile
 - Symlinked Dotfiles
 - Alacritty
 - Doom Emacs
 - Pain

And, getting to the skillset that I've developed, from the last time,
 - Technical Writing
 - I'm seriously clueless.
 - I hit gold in Valorant.

I now spend my days working towards management more than coding, as the Open Source Community begins to work on larger projects, and I direct and support the community as a Vice President.
