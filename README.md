My Git starts off with a hello world.

Hey guys,
My name is Adithya, and I'm using my GitHub account for the first time even though i've had it for multiple days till now.
Feel free to give me advice or feedback, i'll take it as constructive criticism.
Peace!

I'm glad to say that I'm working a lot more on code now, and have been using GitHub a lot more.<br>
While, I haven't made any significant contribution to any large scale project yet, I have learnt to use VCS and GitHub better.
I've tried to work on a variety of projects and would like to show them off.

<a href="https://github.com/dat-adi/Java-Grip">Java-Grip</a>  : A compilation of Java Programs that I've worked on.
<a href="https://github.com/dat-adi/tinyApps">tinyApps</a>   : A few small scale apps that I've developed on an impulse.
<a href="https://github.com/dat-adi/TheDescend">TheDescend</a> : A game project on building a Dungeon RPG.

It has been a long time since an update, but, here's what I've done over the course of 8 months.
In terms of contributions, I've only contributed a single line of code to rptools/maptools, and yet have to add in support for local assets in the application.
I've also changed my account name from Naruita to dat-adi, and have worked on multiple repositories.

I've learnt how to work with Python a lot more in depth than before, and my repository for small applications called `tinyApps` has come a long way with new features, comprising of an automated annotation maker of the files present in a directory, and a web scraping EPUB maker.
Now, the tools that I can use have grown a lot larger, requiring a list of sorts,
 - Beautiful Soup
 - PostgreSQL
 - Tkinter
 - XML -> EPUB Conversion
 - Django Based Web Development
 
 I'm currently directing a team to build a Django-based centralized hub for [Winter Season of Code](https://www.wsocbyosc.com).
