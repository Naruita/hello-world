I'm glad to say that I'm working a lot more on code now, and have been using GitHub a lot more.<br>
While, I haven't made any significant contribution to any large scale project yet, I have learnt to use VCS and GitHub better.
I've tried to work on a variety of projects and would like to show them off.

<a href="https://github.com/Naruita/Java-Grip">Java-Grip</a>  : A compilation of Java Programs that I've worked on.
<a href="https://github.com/Naruita/tinyApps">tinyApps</a>   : A few small scale apps that I've developed on an impulse.
<a href="https://github.com/Naruita/TheDescend">TheDescend</a> : A game project on building a Dungeon RPG.
<a href="https://github.com/atvc19ec/tul-s-corp">Tul's Corp</a> : A collaborative project on making a text based office game, that I've worked on.
